The project I am thinking of doing is recreating a version of flappy bird (the actual object/animal to be flapping to be announced). This took me a long time to come up with, but I think it will be really project to work on and help me develop my coding skills. 

The background knowledge I have is that I used to play flappy bird a lot on my phone when it first became popular. Even during classes, everyone would be playing the game. Unfortunately, the game is no longer available :(. The reason I want to do this project is that it seems challenging but fun project to do and is something I want to try and work on.

For my timeline, my week 1 goal would be to display the rectangles and the object and have it advance frames correctly.
My week 2 goal would be to implement the perimeter methods to detect if it hits the rectangles and have the recantangles spawn with random sizes.
My week 3 goal would be to implement user interface to actually control the object flying.

If I finish early, I would implement gravity so that the object falling would look realistic and I would also add a counter that increases every time the object successfully passes through a rectangle.

Hopefully it goes well!
