Flappy Bird:
The goal of the game is for the player to navigate through pipes with a bird. To do this, the player can press spacebar to allow the bird to jump through the pipes as they pass through the bird. If the player does not press spacebar, the bird will continue to fall until it hits the ground. If the bird hits the ground or a pipe, the game ends and restarts automatically. A player's score increases everytime a player successfully advances to the next pipe. 


How to run Flappy Bird:
The CLion IDE was used to code this project using the Cinder programming library. Once the library is imported to the IDE, the player can simply run the flapybird-simulation to play the game.
